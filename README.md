## Challenge Summary

- **Topic (and why):**  
The project topic is Movies. Watching movies has become one of the most common at-home activities during the pandemic, and people start to switch from going to movie theaters to using movie rentals and streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+. However, it also makes people spend more time on finding the right movie. It will be great if we can have some aspects of the movies we should know before deciding what movie to watch. To help people save time on selecting movies, we will use machine learning techniques to analyze movie data based on different features and to predict movies the viewer may enjoy.  

- **Data Source Description:**  
We decide to use Kaggle as the data source for our project because it provides a vast container of open-access datasets for machine learning. We selected three movie-related datasets from Kaggle: datasets_2745_4700_movies, MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms_updated, and tmdb_5000_movies. We reviewed the datasets and merged them based on the important features for achieving the project goal. We selected the columns that are worth for machine learning, such as budget, gross, genres, production company, star, score, and streaming services, etc. Last, we cleaned the merged dataset and ended up with our raw dataset Merged_Movies_Raw_Dataset of 3188 rows and 24 columns.

- **Questions we hope to answer with data:**  
What aspects make a movie more watchable?  
Can the budget indicate a good movie?  
Are streaming services' movie library offering enough amount of watchable movies?
Can we recommend the viewer ten movies based on the movie entered by the viewer?
Could we predecit a score of a movie that is coming out, or not yet rated?

- **Description of the data exploration phase of the project:**
 Exploring each data set via Tableau and Machine Learning models to see relationships that could help us answer any of the above questions. The budget, revenue, genre, and streaming services all play a major role into understanding the data. Viewing the datasets individually allows us to understand the value of each dataset. 
 
 - **Description of the analysis phase of the project:**
 Analyzing the data with the merge datasets does not tell the full story. However, merging the data allows us to get the data necessary for the Machine Learning models. 



## Communication Protocols
The team will communicate through zoom, slack, and email. The team will meet twice a week outside of class Monday and Wednesday for 20 minutes at 7 pm via zoom to discuss progress and possible issues. Any additional time will be as needed during the weekend.
