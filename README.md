## Presentation

- **Topic (and why):**  
The project topic is Movies. Watching movies has become one of the most common at-home activities during the pandemic, and people start to switch from going to movie theaters to using movie rentals and streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+. However, it also makes people spend more time on finding the right movie. It will be great if we can have some aspects of the movies we should know before deciding what movie to watch. To help people save time on selecting movies, we will use machine learning techniques to analyze movie data based on different features and to predict movies the viewer may enjoy.  

- **Data Source Description:**  
We decide to use Kaggle as the data source for our project because it provides a vast container of open-access datasets for machine learning. We selected three movie-related datasets from Kaggle: datasets_2745_4700_movies, MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms_updated, and tmdb_5000_movies. We reviewed the datasets and merged them based on the important features for achieving the project goal. We selected the columns that are worth for machine learning, such as budget, gross, genres, production company, star, score, and streaming services, etc. Last, we cleaned the merged dataset and ended up with our raw dataset Merged_Movies_Raw_Dataset of 3188 rows and 24 columns.

- **Questions we hope to answer with data:**  
What aspects make a movie more watchable?  
Can the budget indicate a good movie?  
Are streaming services' movie library offering enough amount of watchable movies?  
Can we recommend the viewer ten movies based on the movie entered by the viewer?  
Could we predict a score of a movie that is coming out, or not yet rated?

- **Description of the data exploration phase of the project:**
 Exploring each data set via Tableau and Machine Learning models to see relationships that could help us answer any of the above questions. The budget, revenue, genre, and streaming services all play a major role into understanding the data. Viewing the datasets individually allows us to understand the value of each dataset. 
 Genre and average revenue have an inverse relationship. Over the past 35 years, the average reveune for movies has increased 333%. 
 - **Description of the analysis phase of the project:**
 Analyzing the data with the merge datasets does not tell the full story. However, merging the data allows us to get the data necessary for the Machine Learning models.

## Machine Learning Model 

- **Data preprocessing:**
Before plugging the datasets into any of the machine learning models listed below, we had to do the following:
  - assure the database connection was secured and reliable.
  - Fix quality issues among the datasets (perform CRUD operations, drop null values and clean data).
  - Merge datasets and identify important features and high correlations to drop columns.
  - For streaming services we added '0' for movies that do not have this information after the merge, meaning the stream service was not available.
  - Apply feature engineering libraries (encoding and machine learning dependencies) to categorical variables like: company, rating, country, genre, director and star.
  - For keywords, we extracted from the dictionary only the key "name" to be used in our NLP model.
  - Numerical variables: revenue, votes, released year, score and popularity.
 
 - **Preliminary selection and engineering:**
  
KMeans Clustering: Finding if we can make a cluster classification using KMeans that helps to predict better the score movies. We also plan to use these clusters to assist in filtering movies for recommendation selection.

Linear Regression: the model did not predict score using the model data available.
 
Logistic_Regression: We are using Lasso and ElasticNet algorithms to train the model to get a better prediction of movie score. Currently the ElasticNet algorithm is a better predictor of score, but overall both models have difficulty accurately predicting score because of the limitation of our data. 

TfidfVectorizer function from scikit-learn: transforms text to feature vectors that can be used as input to estimator, we are using “genre” in this case to compute the cosine similarity matrix to calculate a numeric quantity that denotes the similarity between two movies using movies titles.

PCA Hierarchical Clustering: We tried PCA_Hierarchical_Clustering but the explained variance when 2 components were taken was only (0.075, 0.047).

We also tried the random forest because the feature importance, but the model did not work very well trying to get the score_prediction.

### **Machine Learning Final Results
- Logistic Regression Model
  - Output: Score
  - Input: Encoded data (company, directors, revenue language, writer, star, country, genre, rating), budget, title, votes, runtime, released year, popularity
  - **Data Training and Testing split:**
  - Test_size = 0.3, training_size = 0.7 (change size of training and test data from 0.7 to 0.8, and 0.7 and 0.3 give us the best score_prediction)
  - Generate score_prediction using Lasso Regression and ElasticNet Net Regression
  - Lasso: r2 = 0.365
  - ElasticNet: r2 = 0.41

- Kmeans Model
  - Generate elbow curve.
  - Elbow curve shows 3 main clusters.
  - Classes are driven by revenue, we used the classes to set dropdown menu for the movie selection based on funding, we used the classes and classify the movies like: Blockbuster, Average Movies and Underrated.
  - Add class to dataset.

- We added the classes from KMeans model and run the Logistic Regression Model to see if we can get better score prediction.
- Logistic Regression ElasticNet.
  - ElasticNet: r2 = 0.42.
  - Add score_prediction to dataset.

- TfidfVectorizer Model
  - Transform text to feature vectors to be used as input to estimator.
  - Use keywords_name to generate the matrix of numeric quantity that denotes the similarity between two movies based on keywords_name.
  - Generate a function that returns the most similar movies based on cosine similarity score (matrix).
  - Input a title movie and get the “Top Ten Movies Recommendation” based on similarity of the keywords_name of the title movie selected.
  - We added score, score_prediction, genre and class to the result.
  - Finally the code was added to the interactive web app to update results every time an user pick a movie to get the recommendation.


- **Model choice explained:**

- The Kmeans was used to find classes for the data.  We noticed the revenue and budget were a main driver of the classes, but we tried finding how the classes were divided if the revenue and budged were dropped, we found votes are now the driver, if we dropped votes popularity was the driven.  We decided to make the classes using all the data, because to get classes from popularity we had to drop many important variables for machine learning model.  We defined those classes like: Blockbuster, Average Movies and Underrated.

- We wanted to add score prediction to our results, and we found the Logistic Regression ElasticNet gave us the best r2:0.41.  We think adding more variables that correlates the score it will help to improve the prediction.  We tried to improve the prediction adding the classes from KMeans, but the r2 for score_prediction only went from 0.41 to 0.42.  We also tried to improve the prediction changing the size of the training and test datasets, but only improve the r2 by 0.09.  Our best combination was training data: 0.7, testing data: 0.3.  Our proposed for this model it was provide a score prediction for movies based on writer, genre, director, company, rating, country, star, language, runtime, popularity, budget and votes.

- The Natural Language Processing Model will be used because allows to use string data, in this case keywords (keywords to describe the movies), then use the title movie to predict a recommendation. The Machine Learning TfidfVectorizer Model Model takes the keywords_name and generate the similarity matrix for each movie, then the user input a movie and model predicts similar movies based on the keywords_name.  We finally filtered the results by genre and sort the results by score.  We also added the score prediction to the table presented to the user. 

## Database Integration
-  **Connection details:**
AWS and PostgreSQL are connected with the AWS RDS and S3 buckets holding our datasets. The Connection is then used within the jupyter Notebook via SQLAlchemy. The primary utilization of the database will be for connecting our machine learning model results with our interactive website.

You can view the schema file in this repository's master branch labeled "schema.sql".

- **Interactive Element:**
The interative element ustilizes python fuctions, flask routes, html and javastript to produce a web application that allows the user to select a movie based on selected genre and machine learning clustering. Once a displayed movie is selected, the natrual language processing model runs generating a table of the top ten highest rated movies related to the selected movie. The table also displays the genre, score, predicted score results and what streaming service it is viewable on, if any.
The Interactive Element is the labeled file in our master branch, "Updated_Interactive_Web_App_Video_Trim.mp4".
