# Final Project, Team C

## First Segment of Project Overview
This week, each member of the group will be submitting a link to their GitHub repository, which contains all the deliverables for the presentation, GitHub, machine learning model, and database sections.

## Resources
- **Data Source: Kaggle  
  - Potential datasets: datasets_2745_4700_movies, MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms_updated, tmdb_5000_movies

- **Software:  
  - Jupyter Notebook (anaconda python 3.7)  
  - PostgreSQL 11  
  - AWS S3 and RDS  
  - MongoDB  
  - Tableau

## Challenge Summary

- **Topic (and why):** 
Movies. Since we need to stay at home during these days, one of the most common activities is watching movies. We spend hours trying to find the right movie, it will be great if we can have some aspects of the movies we should know before deciding what movie to watch. Our goal for this challenge is to use marchine learning techniques to analyze movie data based on different features and to predict watchable movies.  

- **Data Source Description:**
We selected 3 datasets from Kaggle: datasets_2745_4700_movies, MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms_updated, and tmdb_5000_movies. We reviewed the datasets and the found the datasets datasets_2745_4700_movies and tmdb_5000_movies gave us more variables to be used for the machine learning model. We merged and cleaned these 2 datasets based on our needs and ended up with our raw dataset Merged_Movies_Raw_Dataset of 3188 rows and 24 columns.

- **Questions we hope to answer with data:**
What aspects make a movie more watchable? (We need this for sure for tomorrow)

- **Communication procols:**
Team will communicate through zoom, slack, and email. The team will meet twice a week outside of class Monday and Wednesday for 20 minutes at 7pm via zoom to discuss progress and possible issues. Any additional time will be as needed during the weekend.
